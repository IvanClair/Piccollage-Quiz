1. Q : Which architecture pattern do you choose? Why
   A : MVVM, because Android recommend it

2. Q : What have you learned from RxJava? What's the usecase here? What's the difference when it compares to LiveData?
   A : RxJava makes me feel like it is perfect for functional programming. In the quiz, I use it for network requests. The major difference between live data and RxJava is, live data allow developer to get value from an Observable, but RxJava does not allow that, which I am not used to.

3. Q : Anything you want to point out, for example: a special design, how you solve a problem...
   A : coroutines, RxJava ... why they can not work together ...
